## Mission Statement
To create robust and validated computational pipelines to detect cancer before symptoms become apparent.

## Liquid Biopsy Companies
* [GRAIL](https://grail.com/science/)
* **Liquid biopsy**:  
In contrast to solid biopsies, liquid biopsies is a non-invasive method to detect the presence of small fragments of tumor DNA, known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). ctDNA originates from somatic mutations that occur in the tumor over the course of an individual's life unlike germline mutations that are present in all cells.

## Applied Human Computational Genomics Pipeline
**Purpose**: Call variants in genomic data to detect somatic changes within the pool of circulating nucleic acids
